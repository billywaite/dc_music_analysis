# Washington D.C. Historical Analysis

This is a repo for an analysis I am conducting on historical concert data for all major music venues in Washington D.C. This is a project for personal interest.

### Getting Started

2. Cleaning and consolidating the scraped data - Scripts in the cleaning folder
3. Initial analysis - Dropped the data in Tableau for some quick visualizations
4. Next step is to work with the Spotify API to add genre + popularity
